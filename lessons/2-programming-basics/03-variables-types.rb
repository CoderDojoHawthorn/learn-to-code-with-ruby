# Through a live demo, we'll demonstrate the main types of data available.

# Examples:
# - Fixnum (a whole number)
# - String (text)
# - Float (a number with decimal places)
# - true/false (typically called booleans)
# - Array (lists of other types)
# - Symbols
# - Constants (don't change value)
# - nil
